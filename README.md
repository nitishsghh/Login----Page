# Login Page

This is a basic example of a login page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Description

This project provides a simple login page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the frontend of a typical login form, but it does not include a backend for authentication or user management. It serves as a starting point for building more complex login systems.

## Features

- Basic login form with username and password fields.
- Frontend validation of input fields.
- Minimal styling for a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the login page.
3. Enter a username and password (e.g., "nitisng" and "1234") to simulate a login.

Please note that this is just a frontend example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement the backend authentication and database handling for a secure login system.
